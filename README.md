# Live Digg

Using Tornado, Redis, and MySQL to push new stories from Digg

Just a little weekend experiment in the usage of these technologies together.

### Requirements

You'll need to have the following installed:
 * Python (2.x)
 * Redis
 * MySQL

You'll also need the Python libraries from the requirements.txt file included on your system.

### Demo

I'll get setup shortly and update this.

### Post

A little post I wrote up about [Live Digg](http://mkdir.info/live-digg.html).
